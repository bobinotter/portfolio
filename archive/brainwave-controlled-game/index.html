            <p>A brainwave-controlled game which I designed for UK Trade & Investment which was a sub-department of the UK Government's Department for Business, Innovation & Skills. We developed the game for UKTI's use at international tradeshows. The game's innovative and challenging interaction design was used to attract entrepreneurs to UKTI's exhibiton stands where they could find out more about the benefits of working in the UK.</p>
                
            <p>It is a two-player game where EEG (electroencephalographic) headbands are worn which measure each player’s focus and relaxation. The game then uses these metrics to affect flying characteristics (speed and stability) of each player's spacecraft on screen.</p>
